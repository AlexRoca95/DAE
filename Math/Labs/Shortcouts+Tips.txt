- ALT + Number -> Potencia
- ALT + Letter -> Alpha, Beta etc
- / -> Fracciones
- ALT + O -> degrees symbol
- Use Simplify comand for simplify arithmetics 
- With x and y operations always explicity indicate the * and the + between them
- To resolve equations you just have to put the equation and then click on the 
	x= symbol.

- Use Comand "Solve" for solve operations like sin(30ยบ) = a / 3. It will solve it
for a unknow incognit.

		Creating a triangle
	- You can form a triangle using the polygon tool. You select the 3 vertex 
	and then, if you want, you can change the names of the vertex and sides

	- Now you can obtain alpha angle, for example, by clicking the correct
	three points in the correct order. This is with the "angle" tool
	
	- If I want to check my results of a triangle values I can do it
	in geogebra by creating the rectangle and putting the values and angles
	that I know
