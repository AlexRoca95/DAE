 Ideas: 
	Player vs Player videogame
	Random Map generator
	With one or two powerups
	Instead of tanks with soldiers
	Reference the EpicBattleTank from Leho
	Get Free Sprites from https://craftpix.net/ or other web page
	or https://itch.io/game-assets/free

	
	Pacman game but instead of Pacman we replace it for the minotaur and the
	assests from the laberyinth. Like we can draw a Laberynth (randomly)
	and the objective is to reach one part and to get as many points as you
	can, the points are the same as the pacman balls. Could be more than
	one minotaur.
