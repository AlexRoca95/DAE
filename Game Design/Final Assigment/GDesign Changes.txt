- Movement of the character changed: Before the movement of the player was calculated with the 
Delta Time Seconds which sometimes made the movement different according with the speed of the computer.
Now is working with the character movement given in the framework. Still not the final movement.

- Lighting has been changed. Now is a little bit darker and enemies are wearing a flashlight. This also
represents the area of vision of them. This was due to some feedback received about not knowing that
the first part was supposed to be play in a stealth way and also because this way is easier to see the
enemies come outside the window of the game (before you could be spotted by the enemies without you even
had seen them)

- Now the player can press the M key to show the robery list. This will show the remaining items that
have to still and the amount of money he earned with the the items he already has stolen. ( This is 
in order to explain the purpose of the game. So players know what do they have to do)
 
- Added some accesibility information in the HUD for grabbing an item, opening the robery list, no space
left when trying to grab an object.

- Now the energy drink fill the energy bar entirely instead of increment the speed of the bar.

- I have put an item in front of the player at the beggining of the level. So player can receive some 
info about the keys and the what he has to do.
