- Make it more fun

	. Add elements in the map to make it more fun to play. Like some powerUps for the player. Rn the 
	backpack is okay but I could add more stuff like this so the player feels that searching helps to
	find useful stuff. Like extra time, more space, faster movement, faster delivery of the stolen stuff
	like conducts to the beggining of the game etc etc
	. Add noise to the player stealh part
